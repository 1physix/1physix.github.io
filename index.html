    <h2>Hi there, I'm IshaqðŸ™ƒ</h2>    
    <p>I'm currently studying my A-Levels - Maths, Further Maths, Physics and Computer Science at Trinity School, Croydon.</p>
    <br><p> I enjoy all things tech-related, but I am particularly interested in computer-vision technology and machine learning. Outside of academics, I enjoy programming and playing squash. Feel free to connect with me and send me a message on LinkedIn.</p>
